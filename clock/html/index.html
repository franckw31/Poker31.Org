				<h2>
					Using the clock:
				</h2>The Free Poker Tournament Clock is simple to use and it gives you everything you need to host a poker tournament of any size. The player tab allows you to control the number of players in the game, as well as chips, re-buys and add-ons. Use the pull-down on the structure tab to choose a complete blind level structure for your tournament. The payout tab also includes a pull-down with structures that automatically calculate each payout position. It only takes a few minutes to enter your information and then the clock and all tournament data is displayed on the clock tab. You're ready to shuffle up and deal!
				<h2>
					Buy-in/Re-buys
				</h2>In tournament play, each player buys in for the same set amount of money and they each receive an equal number of chips. The buy-in price is set at the beginning of the game and your amount of starting chips should be determined by the blind structure you want to play with. (See structure tips below.) Most tournaments start players out with chip denominations of $25, $100, $500 and $1000 but you will want to include a $5 chip if you want to use the sit and go structure. Many home games allow a re-buy which gives each player the opportunity to buy additional chips at any time during the first one or two rounds. When the re-buy period ends, there is also an optional add-on which is basically a re-buy that is only available to players who are still alive in the tournament at the end of a certain round. Some tournaments allow you to re-buy or add-on only if you have been eliminated or if your chip stack is below what you began the tournament with. Others allow you to add chips no matter what size your stack might be. The best plan for most tournaments is to end your re-buy period on the first break.
				<h2>
					Structure Tips (Blind progression)
				</h2>The tournament blind structure is the most important aspect of the poker tournament. You will want to choose a structure that is a balance between ending the game at a reasonable time and allowing the players enough time to play patiently. If you want your tournament to end quickly, you can choose a faster structure or start each player out with a smaller amount of chips. Longer tournaments start you with plenty of chips and the blinds move up at a pace that allows everyone to get in on the action. Our poker clock offers a selection of structures and all of them are offered with and without antes. The best rule of thumb for choosing a good structure is to pick one where the final big blind at the time when you want the tournament to end is equal to the amount of chips that each player has. Most home games do not need a structure with antes because the normal blind progression is enough to move the game along. Small tournaments (10 players) should last about an hour. Medium sized tournaments (10-25 players) should last 2-3 hours and large tournaments (30 or more players) should last 3-5 hours
				<h2>
					Player seating
				</h2>Tournament player seating should always be random in order to avoid disputes and to ensure that nobody has an advantage because of seat selection. The easiest way to randomize seat selection is to mark up an old deck of cards with table and seat numbers and have each player take a card when they buy in. Tables should have a maximum of ten players each and tables should be balanced with the same number of players during the tournament. When tables become unbalanced, wait until the end of the hand at the larger table and move the next big blind player to the smaller table.
				<h2>
					Bounties
				</h2>An interesting way to liven up a tournament is to put cash bounties on the heads of a few players or on all of the players. Whoever knocks a bounty player out of the game receives a set cash amount that comes out of the tournament pot. Another way to play with a bounty is to have each player pay their own bounty when someone knocks them out. This small cash prize is paid by each individual player and it does not come out of the tournament pot.
				<h2>
					Payouts
				</h2>In most professional tournaments, about 10% of the field makes the money. The payout structure tends to be steep in these games with the top finishers winning large percentages of the prize pool. Home games tend to have more of a flat payout structure with more players winning a smaller percentage of the total. We have included standard payout structures with this clock, so all you have to do is go to the payout tab and choose the number of players who will win money and the percentages will be calculated for you.
				<h2>
					Coloring up/Chip Racing
				</h2>At some point during the tournament, smaller chips are taken out of circulation because the blind increases have rendered these chips useless. After coloring up, some players may still have smaller denomination chips. These chips will be placed in front of each player and they will receive a single card for each extra chip they have. Once the cards are out, the highest cards will receive an extra larger denomination chip. Players may only receive a single chip while racing and no player can be eliminated from a tournament during the race.
				<h2>
					Basic Rules:
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Cards and chips must be visible on the table at all times. Large chips out front.
					</li>
					<li>Players have the right to request your chip count at any time.
					</li>
					<li>If the dealer accidentally flips over a card, that card will become the first burn card. The player cannot keep it. If the dealer flips two cards while dealing, a misdeal is declared.
					</li>
					<li>No string-bets. Announce that you are betting or raising before you do so. Any other action is considered a call.
					</li>
					<li>The cards speak for themselves. Highest cards win.
					</li>
					<li>No one ever gets to miss their big blind and no one ever has to pay the small blind twice in a row. If the small blind busts out, then the blinds post their money as usual and the button remains where it is. If the big blind busts out, the next big blind posts his money as usual and there is a dead small blind.
					</li>
					<li>The Minimum bet/raise is equal to the BB. Any re-raise must be equal or greater than the previous raise.
					</li>
					<li>When it gets down to heads up, the small blind is the button.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>
					Basic Etiquette:
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't splash the pot. People should be able to see the number of chips bet or called.
					</li>
					<li>Commentary on board cards or possibilities is generally annoying.
					</li>
					<li>Don't discuss your hand until after the hand has been completed. If someone is trying to represent that they are holding 7/6, it becomes much more difficult to do so when you announce that you folded it.
					</li>
					<li>Don't rabbit-hunt excessively (looking at what fourth or fifth street would have been.)
					</li>
					<li>Once eliminated, it is nice if that player becomes the dealer until another player has been eliminated.
					</li>
				</ul>
